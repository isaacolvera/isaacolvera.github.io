                        A group-based machine learning project that classifies a song's 
                        genre and recommends a list of songs utilizing factors such as 
                        tempo, valence, acousticness, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technologies that we used were machine learning (decision trees
                        and k-nearest neighbors) to train, test, and predict the similarity
                        between songs
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Challenges: The main challenge that we faced was understanding how
                        to utilize our dataset to its fullest extent, making sure that all of
                        the factors given to us were examined and trained properly
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcome: After multiple test runs and using several sorting algoritms,
                        we were finally able to create a program that could predict the similarity
                        of a song based on the music dataset given

                        The only major technology used was just python and my wonderful laptop.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Challenges: A lot of what I struggled with when creating this project was
                        trying to incorporate every single rule that exists within Monopoly. This meant
                        I spent multiple hours just making sure my code ran well and that every single
                        rule was accounted for
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcome: A fully functioning Monopoly game that can be played on the terminal
                        with multiple players

                        A python based project that uses an external camera to record 
                        and take pictures of detected bodies and faces that appear 
                        within frame. All videos are saved on the working PC where the 
                        program is running, and the pictures are sent to an authorized 
                        email to act as an alert for the user.

                    <p>
                        Technologies that I used was Python, my laptop, an external camera, and a
                        Google account to store the photos taken

                    <p>
                        Challenges: There was two main challenges that I faced when creaing this project.
                        The first one was sending the photos/videos to the Google account, and the second was
                        understanding how to properly use OpenCV on Python. A lot of times the camera would
                        not properly detect a body or face so I spent a lot of time making sure those parameters
                        were set correctly
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcome: A fully function security program that detects bodies/faces, records videos,
                        saves the video to the user's laptop, and sends photos to the user's google account

                        A first-person, short, survival horror game created using Unity 
                        and its available assests

                    <P>

                    <p>
                        Challenges: Although this project was my first time using C# and Unity to create a
                        game, the overall design and structure of the game was not too difficult. The
                        real challenge came from understanding how to properly use, build, and connect animations
                        with C# code. I am also not very artistic, so I was limited on what I could do animation
                        wise
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outcome: A functioning horror game that is downloadable and playable on your laptop!

                        on a piece of bread in order to earn points and upgrade their 
                        "bread business" (based on the popular Cookie-Clicker game)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Technologies used were HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also implemented backend
                        into our website, but I can not take credit for that as it was one of our group mates
                        that did all of the work for it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Challenges: The challenges that my teammates faced while building our website
                        was understanding how to incorporate JavaScript into HTML/CSS. We also struggled
                        with connecting the Frontend and Backend together.

                    <p>
                        Outcome: A semi-working but playable game that is available on itch.io. Although
                        the backend is not incorporated, the game is still functional and works
